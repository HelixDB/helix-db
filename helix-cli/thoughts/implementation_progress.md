- Error handling for network issues

### 4. Push Command Enhancement (`src/commands/push.rs`)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Implementation Details:**
- Detection of anonymous cloud configurations
- Docker image tagging with cloud registry format
- Integration with cloud deployment API
- Status reporting during deployment process

**Deployment Flow:**
1. Detect anonymous cloud configuration
2. Tag Docker image for cloud registry
3. Push image to cloud repository
4. Trigger cloud deployment via API
5. Report deployment status to user

### 5. Cloud Management Commands (`src/commands/cloud.rs`)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (New File)

**Implementation Details:**
- Created dedicated cloud command module
- Implemented two core commands:
  - `helix cloud status <instance>` - Check instance status
  - `helix cloud claim <instance>` - Claim anonymous instance
- Proper authentication validation for claim operations
- Clear status reporting for deployment states

**Command Features:**
- Comprehensive status information display
- Authentication requirement validation
- Clear error messages and user guidance
- Integration with existing CLI patterns

### 6. Command Integration Updates
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Files Modified:**
- `src/commands/delete.rs` - Anonymous cloud instance handling
- `src/commands/start.rs` - Cloud instance lifecycle awareness
- `src/commands/stop.rs` - Cloud instance management limitations
- `src/commands/status.rs` - Anonymous cloud instance display

**Integration Features:**
- Consistent handling across all commands
- Appropriate messaging for cloud-specific limitations
- Seamless user experience regardless of deployment type

### 7. Main CLI Updates (`src/main.rs`)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Implementation Details:**
- Added `CloudAction` enum for cloud operations
- Extended `CloudDeploymentTypeCommand` with `Dev` variant
- Integrated cloud command handler
- Updated command routing for new cloud commands

## Implementation Statistics

**New Files Created:**
- `src/cloud_client.rs` - 250+ lines
- `src/commands/cloud.rs` - 120+ lines

**Files Modified:**
- `src/config.rs` - Enhanced configuration structures
- `src/commands/init.rs` - Added cloud deployment support
- `src/commands/push.rs` - Cloud deployment integration
- `src/commands/delete.rs` - Cloud instance awareness
- `src/commands/start.rs` - Cloud lifecycle handling
- `src/commands/stop.rs` - Cloud management limitations
- `src/commands/status.rs` - Cloud instance display
- `src/main.rs` - Command routing updates

**Total Lines Added:** ~600+ lines of Rust code

## User Workflow Implementation

### Complete Anonymous Deployment Flow
✅ **Initialization:** `helix init cloud dev`
- Creates anonymous cloud instance
- Stores credentials in `helix.toml`
- Displays instance ID and expiration

✅ **Building:** `helix build dev`
- Uses existing build infrastructure
- Creates Docker image for deployment

✅ **Deployment:** `helix push dev`
- Tags image for cloud registry
- Pushes to cloud repository
- Triggers deployment via API

✅ **Status Checking:** `helix cloud status dev`
- Shows current deployment status
- Displays instance information
- Reports any deployment issues

✅ **Claiming (Optional):** `helix cloud claim dev`
- Requires user authentication
- Associates instance with user account
- Enables long-term management

## Technical Achievements
