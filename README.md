<hr>

HelixDB was built on the thesis that current database infrastructure is built for how humans think about data, not AI. So we've built a database that makes it easy to build all the components needed for an AI application in a single platform.

You no longer need a separate application DB, vector DB, graph DB, or application layers to manage the multiple storage locations. All you need to build any application that uses AI, agents or RAG, is a single HelixDB cluster and HelixQL; we take care of the rest.

HelixDB primarily operates with a graph + vector data model, but it can also support support KV, documents, and relational data.

## Key Features

|                                  |                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Built-in MCP tools**           | Helix has built-in MCP support to allow your agents to discover data and walk the graph rather than having to generate human readable queries, letting agents actually think. |
| **Built-in Embeddings**          | Don't worry about needing to embed your data before sending it to Helix, just use the `Embed` function to vectorize text.                                                     |
| **Tooling for Knowledge Graphs** | It is super easy to ingest your unstructured data into a knowledge graph, with our integrations for Zep-AI's Graphiti, and our own implementation of OpenAI's KG tool.        |
| **Tooling for RAG**              | HelixDB has a built-in vector search, keyword search, and hybrid search that can be used to power your RAG applications.                                                      |
| **Secure by Default**            | HelixDB is private by default. You can only access your data through your compiled HelixQL queries.                                                                           |
| **Logical Isolation**            | Each Helix cluster is logically isolated in its own VPC meaning only you can ever see your data.                                                                              |
| **Ultra-Low Latency**            | Helix is built in Rust and uses LMDB as its storage engine to provide extremely low latencies.                                                                                |

## Getting Started

#### Helix CLI

The Helix CLI tool can be used to check, compile and deploy Helix locally.

1. Install CLI

   ```bash
   curl -sSL "https://install.helix-db.com" | bash
   ```

2. Install Helix

   ```bash
   helix install
   ```

3. Setup

   ```bash
   helix init --path <path-to-project>
   ```

4. Write queries

   Open your newly created `.hx` files and start writing your schema and queries.
   Head over to [our docs](https://docs.helix-db.com/introduction/cookbook/basic) for more information about writing queries

   ```js
   QUERY addUser(name: String, age: I64) =>
      user <- AddN<User({name: name, age: age})
      RETURN user

   QUERY getUser(user_name: String) =>
      user <- N<User::WHERE(_::{name}::EQ(user_name))
      RETURN user
   ```

5. Check your queries compile before building them into API endpoints (optional)

   ```bash
   # in ./<path-to-project>
   helix check
   ```

6. Deploy your queries

   ```bash
   # in ./<path-to-project>
   helix deploy
   ```

7. Start calling them using our [TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/HelixDB/helix-ts) or [Python SDK](https://github.com/HelixDB/helix-py). For example:

   ```typescript
   import HelixDB from "helix-ts";

   // Create a new HelixDB client
   // The default port is 6969
   const client = new HelixDB();

   // Query the database
   await client.query("addUser", {
     name: "John",
     age: 20,
   });

   // Get the created user
   const user = await client.query("getUser", {
     user_name: "John",
   });

   console.log(user);
   ```

Other commands:

- `helix instances` to see all your local instances.
- `helix stop <instance-id>` to stop your local instance with specified id.
- `helix stop --all` to stop all your local instances.
- `helix dockerdev run` to start a Docker development instance.
- `helix dockerdev status` to check the Docker development instance status.
- `helix dockerdev logs` to view Docker container logs.
- `helix dockerdev stop` to stop the Docker development instance.
- `helix dockerdev delete` to remove the Docker development instance and data.

## Roadmap

Our current focus areas include:

- Organizational auth to manage teams, and Helix clusters.
- Improvements to our server code to massively improve network IO performance and scalability.
- More 3rd party integrations to make it easier to build with Helix.
- Guides and educational content to help you get started with Helix.
- Binary quantisation for even better performance.

Long term projects:

- In-house SOTA knowledge graph ingestion tool for any data source.
- In-house graph-vector storage engine (to replace LMDB)
- In-house network protocol & serdes libraries (similar to protobufs/gRPC)
