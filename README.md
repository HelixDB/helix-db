<hr>

HelixDB was built on the thesis that current database infrastructure is built for how humans think about data, not AI. So we've built a database that makes it easy to build all the components needed for an AI application in a single platform.

You no longer need a separate application DB, vector DB, graph DB, or application layers to manage the multiple storage locations. All you need to build any application that uses AI, agents or RAG, is a single HelixDB cluster and HelixQL; we take care of the rest.

HelixDB primarily operates with a graph + vector data model, but it can also support support KV, documents, and relational data.

## Key Features

|                                  |                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Built-in MCP tools**           | Helix has built-in MCP support to allow your agents to discover data and walk the graph rather than having to generate human readable queries, letting agents actually think. |
| **Built-in Embeddings**          | Don't worry about needing to embed your data before sending it to Helix, just use the `Embed` function to vectorize text.                                                     |
| **Tooling for Knowledge Graphs** | It is super easy to ingest your unstructured data into a knowledge graph, with our integrations for Zep-AI's Graphiti, and our own implementation of OpenAI's KG tool.        |
| **Tooling for RAG**              | HelixDB has a built-in vector search, keyword search, and hybrid search that can be used to power your RAG applications.                                                      |
| **Secure by Default**            | HelixDB is private by default. You can only access your data through your compiled HelixQL queries.                                                                           |
| **Logical Isolation**            | Each Helix cluster is logically isolated in its own VPC meaning only you can ever see your data.                                                                              |
| **Ultra-Low Latency**            | Helix is built in Rust and uses LMDB as its storage engine to provide extremely low latencies.                                                                                |

## Getting Started

#### Helix CLI

The Helix CLI tool can be used to check, compile and deploy Helix locally.

1. Install CLI

   ```bash
   curl -sSL "https://install.helix-db.com" | bash
   ```

2. Install Helix

   ```bash
   helix install
   ```

3. Setup

   ```bash
   helix init --path <path-to-project>
   ```

4. Write queries

   Open your newly created `.hx` files and start writing your schema and queries.
   Head over to [our docs](https://docs.helix-db.com/introduction/cookbook/basic) for more information about writing queries

   ```js
   QUERY addUser(name: String, age: I64) =>
      user <- AddN<User({name: name, age: age})
      RETURN user

   QUERY getUser(user_name: String) =>
      user <- N<User::WHERE(_::{name}::EQ(user_name))
      RETURN user
   ```

5. Check your queries compile before building them into API endpoints (optional)

   ```bash
   # in ./<path-to-project>
   helix check
   ```

6. Deploy your queries

   ```bash
   # in ./<path-to-project>
   helix deploy
   ```

7. Start calling them using our [TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/HelixDB/helix-ts) or [Python SDK](https://github.com/HelixDB/helix-py). For example:

   ```typescript
   import HelixDB from "helix-ts";

   // Create a new HelixDB client
   // The default port is 6969
   const client = new HelixDB();

   // Query the database
   await client.query("addUser", {
     name: "John",
     age: 20,
   });

   // Get the created user
   const user = await client.query("getUser", {
     user_name: "John",
   });

   console.log(user);
   ```

Other commands:

- `helix instances` to see all your local instances.
- `helix stop <instance-id>` to stop your local instance with specified id.
- `helix stop --all` to stop all your local instances.
- `helix dockerdev run` to start a Docker development instance.
- `helix dockerdev status` to check the Docker development instance status.
- `helix dockerdev logs` to view Docker container logs.
- `helix dockerdev stop` to stop the Docker development instance.
- `helix dockerdev delete` to remove the Docker development instance and data.

## Roadmap

Our current focus areas include:

- Organizational auth to manage teams, and Helix clusters.
- Improvements to our server code to massively improve network IO performance and scalability.
- More 3rd party integrations to make it easier to build with Helix.
- Guides and educational content to help you get started with Helix.
- Binary quantisation for even better performance.

Long term projects:

- In-house SOTA knowledge graph ingestion tool for any data source.
- In-house graph-vector storage engine (to replace LMDB)
- In-house network protocol & serdes libraries (similar to protobufs/gRPC)

# Helix Engine Critical Bug and Performance Audit Report

**Date:** 2025-09-28
**Audit Scope:** Helix Engine Core Codebase
**Severity Levels:** Critical | High | Medium

---

## Executive Summary

This audit identified **5 critical/high severity issues** in the Helix engine that pose immediate production risks. The most severe issues include panic-inducing code paths, memory corruption risks, and unbounded resource consumption. These issues require immediate attention before production deployment.

**Key Statistics:**
- **Critical Issues:** 2 (immediate crash/corruption risks)
- **High Priority Issues:** 3 (service disruption risks)
- **Medium Priority Issues:** 5+ (reliability concerns)

---

## Critical Findings (Immediate Action Required)

### 1. Vector Core HNSW Insert Panic ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**

**File:** `vector_core/vector_core.rs:511`
**Severity:** Critical
**Category:** Panic Path

**Issue:**
```rust
curr_ep = nearest.peek().unwrap().clone();
```
Unchecked `unwrap()` call on search results that could be empty.

**Trigger Scenario:**
- Empty HNSW search results during vector insertion
- Corrupted indices in high-dimensional spaces
- Edge cases with sparse vector data

**Impact:** Immediate panic causing complete service crash during vector operations

**Recommended Fix:**
```rust
curr_ep = nearest.peek()
    .ok_or(VectorError::VectorCoreError("Empty search result".to_string()))?
    .clone();
```

---

### 2. Vector Deserialization Memory Corruption ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**

**File:** `vector_core/vector.rs:155`
**Severity:** Critical
**Category:** Memory Safety

**Issue:**
```rust
let value = f64::from_be_bytes(chunk.try_into().unwrap());
```
Unchecked byte-to-f64 conversion without validation.

**Trigger Scenario:**
- Corrupted database files
- Malformed vector data from external sources
- Byte sequences that don't align to f64 boundaries

**Impact:**
- Panic on invalid byte sequences
- Potential memory corruption with invalid f64 values
- Data integrity compromise

**Recommended Fix:**
```rust
let value = f64::from_be_bytes(
    chunk.try_into()
        .map_err(|_| VectorError::InvalidVectorData)?
);
```

---

## High Priority Issues (Service Disruption Risks)

### 3. Unbounded Memory Growth in BM25 Search üî¥ **HIGH**

**File:** `bm25/bm25.rs:434`
**Severity:** High
**Category:** Resource Exhaustion

**Issue:**
```rust
let mut combined_scores: HashMap<u128, f32> = HashMap::new();
// No capacity limits or size checks
```

**Trigger Scenario:**
- Large document collections (>1M documents)
- Malicious queries with broad search terms
- Combinatorial explosion in multi-term searches

**Impact:**
- Out-of-memory crashes
- Service degradation under load
- Potential DoS vulnerability

**Recommended Fix:**
```rust
const MAX_RESULTS: usize = 100_000;
let mut combined_scores: HashMap<u128, f32> = HashMap::with_capacity(
    initial_results.len().min(MAX_RESULTS)
);
// Implement streaming for larger result sets
```

---

### 4. Unsafe Database Operations Without Validation üî¥ **HIGH**

**File:** `storage_core/mod.rs:77-83`
**Severity:** High
**Category:** Safety/Security

**Issue:**
```rust
let graph_env = unsafe {
    EnvOpenOptions::new()
        .map_size(db_size * 1024 * 1024 * 1024)
        .max_dbs(20)
        .max_readers(200)
        .open(Path::new(path))?  // No path validation
};
```

**Trigger Scenario:**
- Invalid or malicious file paths
- Insufficient permissions
- Disk space exhaustion
- Path traversal attacks

**Impact:**
- File system corruption
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data loss

**Recommended Fix:**
```rust
// Validate path before unsafe operation
let path = Path::new(path);
if !path.is_absolute() || !path.parent().map_or(false, |p| p.exists()) {
    return Err(StorageError::InvalidPath);
}
// Check disk space
if available_space(path)? < db_size * 1024 * 1024 * 1024 {
    return Err(StorageError::InsufficientSpace);
}
// Then proceed with unsafe block
```

---

### 5. Potential Infinite Loops in Graph Traversal üî¥ **HIGH**

**File:** `traversal_core/ops/util/paths.rs:74-95`
**Severity:** High
**Category:** Performance/Availability

**Issue:**
```rust
while let Some(current_id) = queue.pop_front() {
    // No depth limit or cycle detection
    // Graph traversal continues indefinitely
}
```

**Trigger Scenario:**
- Cyclic graphs
- Extremely deep graphs (>10k nodes deep)
- Large, densely connected graphs
- Maliciously crafted graph structures

**Impact:**
- Service hangs
- CPU exhaustion
- Denial of service
- Timeout cascades in dependent services

**Recommended Fix:**
```rust
const MAX_DEPTH: usize = 1000;
let mut visited = HashSet::with_capacity(estimated_nodes);
let mut depth = 0;

while let Some((current_id, current_depth)) = queue.pop_front() {
    if current_depth > MAX_DEPTH {
        return Err(TraversalError::MaxDepthExceeded);
    }
    if !visited.insert(current_id) {
        continue; // Skip already visited nodes
    }
    // Process node...
}
```

---

## Medium Priority Issues

### Array Index Operations Without Bounds Checking

**Files:** `storage_core/mod.rs` (lines 209, 210, 224, 225, 235, 236, 247, 252)
**Issue:** Direct slice indexing that could panic on malformed keys
```rust
key[0..4]  // Could panic if key.len() < 4
```
**Fix:** Use `key.get(0..4).ok_or(Error::InvalidKey)?`

### Missing Transaction Rollback Handling

**Issue:** Error paths don't always rollback transactions
**Impact:** Potential data inconsistency
**Fix:** Implement RAII pattern for automatic rollback

### Performance Bottlenecks

- O(n) lookups in hot paths that could use indexing
- Missing `with_capacity()` for frequently used collections
- Unnecessary cloning in tight loops

---

## Risk Matrix

| Component | Critical | High | Medium | Risk Level |
|-----------|----------|------|--------|------------|
| Vector Core | 2 | 0 | 2 | üî¥ Critical |
| BM25 Search | 0 | 1 | 1 | üü† High |
| Storage Core | 0 | 1 | 3 | üü† High |
| Graph Traversal | 0 | 1 | 0 | üü† High |

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)
1. **Fix all critical unwrap() calls** - Replace with proper error handling
2. **Add bounds checking** for all array/slice operations
3. **Implement emergency resource limits** for unbounded collections
4. **Deploy monitoring** for panic detection in production

### Short-term (Month 1)
1. **Comprehensive error handling audit** - Remove all unwrap/expect in production paths
2. **Resource limit implementation** - Add configurable limits for all collections
3. **Cycle detection** in all graph algorithms
4. **Fuzz testing** for vector and serialization code

### Long-term (Quarter)
1. **Memory profiling** and optimization
2. **Circuit breaker patterns** for expensive operations
3. **Graceful degradation** strategies
4. **Comprehensive integration test suite** with adversarial inputs

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Critical Test Cases to Add
1. **Empty/Null Handling:** Test all functions with empty inputs
2. **Boundary Conditions:** Maximum sizes, minimum values
3. **Malformed Data:** Corrupted vectors, invalid byte sequences
4. **Cyclic Graphs:** Test traversal with intentionally cyclic structures
5. **Resource Exhaustion:** Large-scale operations approaching memory limits

### Fuzzing Targets
- Vector serialization/deserialization
- Graph traversal algorithms
- BM25 query parsing
- Storage key generation

---

## Conclusion

The Helix engine shows good architectural design but contains several critical production-readiness issues. The identified panic paths and unbounded resource consumption patterns pose immediate risks to system stability.

**Production Readiness Assessment:** ‚ùå **Not Ready**

The codebase requires immediate attention to the critical issues before production deployment. Estimated time to production-ready: 2-3 weeks with focused effort on critical/high priority issues.
